Access your user settings to generate API tokens for automation, view your current role and permissions, and manage your profile.

## Access User Settings

Click on your **profile avatar** in the top-right corner of the header → Select **User Details**

## API Tokens

Generate tokens for API authentication and automation workflows.

**Generate Token:**
1. Click **Generate Token** on the User Details page
2. Copy the generated token immediately
3. Store it securely (token is shown only once)

**Use Cases:**
- API authentication
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Automated test execution
- Third-party tool integration

<Aside type="caution" title="Security">
  Tokens provide full API access with your permissions. Never share tokens or commit them to version control.
</Aside>

**Delete Token:**
Click **Delete Token** → Confirm → Token is revoked immediately

<Aside type="note">
  Deleting a token will break any integrations using it. Generate a new token before deleting the old one to avoid downtime.
</Aside>

**Role Levels:**
