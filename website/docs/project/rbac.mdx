description: Understand role-based access control and permissions in Checkmate
---

Checkmate uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage permissions. Each user is assigned a role that determines what they can view and modify.

## Role Hierarchy

Roles are hierarchical - higher roles inherit all permissions from lower roles.

### Reader (View-Only)

**Capabilities:**
- View projects, tests, and runs
- Download reports and test data
- View user details
- Generate personal API tokens
- Access all read-only APIs

**Cannot:**
- Create or modify any resources
- Delete anything
- Change user roles

**Use Case:** External stakeholders, observers, or team members who need visibility without editing rights.

### User (Standard)

**Capabilities:**
- All Reader permissions, plus:
- Create and edit tests
- Create and edit test runs
- Update test statuses
- Add labels, squads, and sections
- Bulk operations (import, export, update)
- Delete tests

**Cannot:**
- Manage projects (create, edit, delete)
- Delete or reset runs
- Manage user roles
- Lock/unlock runs

**Use Case:** QA engineers, testers, developers who actively work with tests and runs.

### Admin (Full Access)

**Capabilities:**
- All User permissions, plus:
- Create, edit, and archive projects
- Delete and reset runs
- Lock and unlock runs
- Remove tests from runs
- Manage user roles
- Access admin panel
- View all users

**Use Case:** Team leads, project managers, administrators who need full control over projects and users.

## API Permissions

Each role has access to specific API endpoints. See the [API Documentation](/docs/guides/api/) for detailed endpoint information.

### Admin-Only APIs

Admin users have exclusive access to these management endpoints:

- **Project Management:** Create, edit, archive projects
- **Run Management:** Delete runs, reset all test statuses, remove tests from runs, lock/unlock runs
- **User Management:** Update user roles, view all users

### User APIs

User role can access these operational endpoints:

- **Test Management:** Create, edit, delete tests (single and bulk)
- **Run Management:** Create and edit runs
- **Test Execution:** Update test statuses in runs
- **Organization:** Add labels, squads, sections

### Reader APIs

Reader role has access to all read-only endpoints:

- **Data Retrieval:** Get projects, tests, runs, users, organizations
- **Reports:** Download test data and run reports
- **Metadata:** Get labels, squads, sections, priorities, platforms
- **Personal:** Generate/delete own API tokens

## Best Practices

- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Assign users the minimum role needed for their responsibilities
- **Regular Reviews:** Periodically review user roles and permissions
- **Admin Limitation:** Limit Admin role to trusted team leads and managers
- **Token Security:** Treat API tokens as passwords - never share or commit them

:::caution
  Admin users have full access to all projects and data. Only assign this role to trusted team members.
