Test runs let you execute test cases and track their results. Create targeted runs with filters, update test statuses in real-time, and lock runs when complete.

## View & Filter Runs

The runs page displays all test runs for a project. Toggle between:

- **Active Runs** - Currently in progress
- **Locked Runs** - Completed and read-only

Use the search bar to filter runs by name.

## Create a Run

**From Tests Page:**
Click **New** → **Add Run** → Enter run name and description → **Create**

**From Runs Page:**
Click **New Run** and configure:

**Required:**
- **Run Name** - Descriptive name for the run
- **Run Description** - Brief description of the testing scope

**Optional - Filter Tests:**
Apply filters to include only specific tests in the run:
- Filter by Squad, Labels, or other attributes
- Use **AND/OR** logic for complex filtering
- Preview test count before creating

:::tip
  Use filters to create targeted runs (e.g., only high-priority tests or specific feature tests).

## Execute Tests

Click on any run to view and update test statuses.

**Update Status:**
Click on a test → **Add Result** → Select status and add comments → **Submit**

**Available Statuses:**
- Passed
- Failed
- Blocked

- Skipped
- Untested (default)

**Bulk Actions:**
- Select multiple tests → **Add Result** to update in bulk
- Filter tests within the run for focused testing

## Lock/Unlock Runs

Lock completed runs to prevent accidental changes.

**Lock:** Click **Lock** → Run becomes read-only
**Unlock:** Click **Unlock** → Run becomes editable again (Admin only)

:::note
  Locked runs show who locked them and when. Only administrators can delete runs.
:::

## Edit a Run

Click **Edit** on any run to update:
- Run name
- Run description
- Add/remove tests

Changes are saved immediately.

## Reset Run

Reset all test statuses in a run back to "Untested".

Click **Reset** → Confirm → All results are cleared

:::caution
  Resetting a run removes all test results permanently. This cannot be undone.
:::

## Remove Tests

Remove specific tests from a run without deleting them from the project.

Select tests → **Remove Tests** → Confirm

## Download Report

Export run results as CSV for reporting and analysis.

Click **Download** → CSV downloads with all test results and metadata

**Report Includes:**
- Test names and IDs
- Current status
- Comments and notes
- Tester information
- Execution timestamps
