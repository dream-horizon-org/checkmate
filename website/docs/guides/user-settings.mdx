## API Tokens

Generate tokens for API authentication and automation workflows.

**Generate Token:**

3. Store it securely (token is shown only once)

Tokens provide full API access with your permissions. Never share tokens or commit them to version control.

:::note
  Deleting a token will break any integrations using it. Generate a new token before deleting the old one to avoid downtime.
